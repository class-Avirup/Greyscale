## IMAGE PROCESSING UNIT
we have considered luminosity algorithm as our source algorithm 

ðŸŒŸ What is the Luminosity Algorithm?

The luminosity algorithm is a simple way to convert a color image (RGB) into a grayscale image â€” but it does it smartly. Instead of just averaging the red, green, and blue values, it takes into account how bright each color appears to our eyes.

Why not just average RGB?

If you simply average red, green, and blue like this: 
## Grayscale = (R + G + B) / 3

Then Youâ€™d get a dull result because our eyes donâ€™t treat all colors equally. We see green as brighter than red, and red as brighter than blue.

So we rather use this: 
## Grayscale = 0.299  * R + 0.587 * G +  0.114 * B

Proposed technique of RGB to Gray conversion

It can be observed
that there is a reduction of 94% and 85.71% in LUT and Flip Flop requirements, respectively, for the proposed architecture.Hence we are using it in our SoC
